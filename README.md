## Project Overview

Predictive maintenance is crucial for the manufacturing industry to prevent unexpected equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. This project leverages geometric deep learning and advanced data science tools to develop a predictive maintenance system using sensor data from industrial equipment. The goal is to accurately predict equipment failures and enhance maintenance efficiency.

## Goals

1. **Develop a Geometric Deep Learning Model**:
   - Utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture complex relationships between components of industrial machinery and predict equipment failures.

2. **Leverage the Latest Data Science Tools**:
   - Incorporate modern machine learning frameworks and techniques such as PyTorch Geometric, DGL, and TensorFlow.
   - Implement attention mechanisms, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning to enhance the model.

3. **Utilize Readily Available Data**:
   - Use publicly available datasets from sources like the NASA Prognostics Data Repository, MIMII dataset (ToyADMOS), and Kaggle.
   - Implement web scraping to gather additional relevant data.

## Scope

The project encompasses the following:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering and preprocessing sensor data from industrial machinery.
- **Graph Construction**: Representing machinery components and their interactions as graphs.
- **Model Development**: Creating and training GNN-based models.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing techniques to detect abnormal sensor readings.
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Using reinforcement learning to optimize maintenance schedules.
- **Visualization and Deployment**: Developing a user-friendly interface and deploying the model as a web service.
